	Reviewing how to change SharePoint entries in the roster via PowerShell
	Have to Use PowerShell 7
	
	
	Connect-PNPOnline -url "https://uniqueParentCompanyinc.sharepoint.com/EmployeeRoster/Taneytown/" -Interactive
	Get-PNPList
	
	#Get the ID of the user we are trying to edit here
	Get-PnPListItem -List "Taneytown Office Employee Roster" 
	
	
	#The following command is used to expose all of the values that are set for the user with the specified ID 
	
	(Get-PnPListItem -List "Taneytown Office Employee Roster" -ID 455).fieldvalues
	
	FieldName / Key to Modify: JobTitle
	
	#The following sets the values in SharePoint, the first entry is the key to modify, the second entry is the value to add/modify 
	Set-PnPListItem -List "Taneytown Office Employee Roster" -Identity 455 -Values @{"JobTitle"="GIT System Administrator"} -UpdateType UpdateOverwriteVersion
	
	Modified by field adds my username, which is based off my -interactive login for Connect-PNPOnline
